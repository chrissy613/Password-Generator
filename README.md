# Password-Generator
I was very overwhelmed with this assignment but I tried my best. 
I started by adding the variables for the password itself, the letters, numbers, and special characters. 
Then I added the prompt for integer input and the confirms for the rest of the variables. 
It's at this point that I got stumped for hours trying different if, else if, and else statements because sometimes some of them caused the button to do nothing or not what I wanted.
